                <p>Welcome to my page. I am new to coding and I am looking forward to gain all the knowledge that this
                    bootcamp has to offer. This journey that I am about to embark on is just the beginning to a new
                    chapter in my life. My first few chapters consist of learning, loving, and growing. I grew up in a
                    small town outside of Palm Springs in Southern California.My family is my everything and having to
                    make a decision to stay or go seemed like a huge decision for a young adult to make. After I
                    graduated high school I moved to Monterey, California to pursue my dream of attending a university
                    by the beach. During my time at <em>California State University Monterey Bay (CSUMB) </em>I joined a
                    fraternity (Omega Delta Phi), studied abroad in Florence, Italy, and had a very active social life.
                    After receiving my degree in Human Communication I decided to give my self time to rest and
                    rejuvenate by focusing solely on myself. I worked in the food and beverage industry for some time
                    before I made the switch to education. I am currently a paraprofessional II with the Redlands school
                    district. During my time with the district I have learned so much and have been inspired to continue
                    my education.
                    From the time that I graduated from CSUMB until recently I felt like I was in limbo. I just went
                    through the motions of life. When the Covid19 pandemic hit us in 2020 the world had come to a halt.
                    With this extra time that this pandemic gave us I decided that it was time to jump out of my comfort
                    zone.I hope to learn and continue to grow in this field. </p>
